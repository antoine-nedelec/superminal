# Superminal: terminal customization
Clone all the content in your root folder, then launch `~/superminal/init.sh`

# Beneficials
- Nice and pretty prompt :)

#### GIT
- Show the GIT branch of the current folder at the end of your prompt
- GIT completions (with tab) + git shortcuts (such as `git st`, `git co`, `gitlog`, ...)

#### ALIASES
- `ll`, simpler`than `ls -alh
- `..` & `...`, simpler than `cd ..` and `cd ../..`

#### COOL SCRIPTS
- `sup_find -h` -> powerful finder 
- `sup_replace -h` -> powerful replacer
- `sup_cache -h` -> symfony cache remover
- `sup_du -h` -> file / folder size
- `sup_docker_cleanup -h` -> strong docker cleanup
- `sup_docker_karcher -h` -> **superstrong** docker cleanup, use with caution

Launch:
 - `sup_long` to have **long PS1** and **carriage return** at the end of the line
 - `sup_short` to have **short PS1**, and path **is shortened**
